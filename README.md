# Shadow
ðŸš€Shadow is an advanced, customizable web proxy that enables users to access the internet without restrictions. It is a tool that advocates for free speech, privacy, and transparency. Shadow is built on Node.js and Ultraviolet by Titanium Network, and can be easily customized and configured to meet individual user needs.

# Future Plans
Shadow aims to bring more customization options for its users with Shadow:settings. The following settings will be included in the upcoming release:
